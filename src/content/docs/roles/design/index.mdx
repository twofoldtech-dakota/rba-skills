description: AI skills for RBA's design pillar — UX design, UI design, and accessibility

import { Card, CardGrid, LinkCard } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Design is one of RBA's three core pillars. Our designers create experiences that are beautiful, intuitive, and accessible — grounded in research and validated through testing.

These skills help design teams leverage AI for audits, documentation, and design-system work while maintaining the craft that defines RBA's design practice.
