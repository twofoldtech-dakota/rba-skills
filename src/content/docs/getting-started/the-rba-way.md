title: The RBA Way

RBA Consulting (est. 2006, Wayzata, MN) is a digital consulting agency built on three pillars: **Strategy, Design, and Engineering**. Every engagement — from a small website redesign to a multi-year enterprise platform — is structured around these three disciplines working together.

## The Three Pillars

### Strategy

Strategy defines the *what* and *why*. Our strategists — project managers, business analysts, digital strategists, content specialists, and SEO experts — work with clients to define objectives, scope, and success criteria before a single wireframe is drawn or line of code is written.

**AI skills for Strategy** help teams generate project briefs, research technologies, audit content models, and document requirements faster — without sacrificing the rigor that good strategy demands.

### Design

Design defines the *how it feels*. Our designers create experiences that are beautiful, intuitive, and accessible. They work from research and validate through testing, ensuring that what gets built actually works for the people using it.

**AI skills for Design** help teams audit accessibility, document user flows, and review design patterns — accelerating the documentation that surrounds design work without replacing the creative judgment at its core.

### Engineering

Engineering defines the *how it's built*. Our engineers build and deliver across Sitecore, Umbraco, Optimizely, and Azure — from headless front-ends to enterprise integrations to cloud infrastructure.

**AI skills for Engineering** help teams scaffold components, review code for security and performance, generate sprint summaries, and automate the repetitive parts of development — so engineers spend more time solving problems and less time on boilerplate.

## Engagement Models

RBA delivers work through several models. AI skills adapt to each:

| Model | Description | How Skills Help |
|-------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Team Augmentation** | RBA team members embed in the client's team | Skills ensure RBA's quality standards even when working in client environments |
| **Co-Delivery** | RBA and client teams collaborate as one unit | Shared skills create consistent artifacts across both teams |
| **Project Delivery** | RBA owns delivery end-to-end | Skills accelerate every phase from discovery through launch |
| **Managed Services** | RBA provides ongoing support and optimization | Skills standardize maintenance workflows across clients |

## Partnership Ecosystem

RBA's technology skills map to our actual partnership ecosystem:

- **Sitecore Platinum Partner** — Hundreds of implementations from XP to XM Cloud
- **Umbraco Gold Partner** — Full lifecycle from v7 legacy through v13+ modern
- **Optimizely Partner** — CMS, commerce, and content marketing platform delivery
- **Microsoft Azure** — Cloud infrastructure, DevOps, and AI services

These aren't generic technology skills. They encode patterns from real projects delivered by RBA's team — the specific approaches that work in practice, not just in theory.

## AI as a Force Multiplier

AI skills don't replace expertise — they amplify it. A project manager who's written 50 project briefs can use a skill to draft the 51st in minutes instead of hours, then apply their judgment to refine it. An engineer who's built hundreds of Sitecore components can scaffold the next one instantly, then focus on the business logic that actually requires thinking.

The Intelligence Hub captures RBA's collective patterns so that every team member — whether they've been at RBA for ten years or ten days — can deliver work that meets the standard RBA's clients expect.
