---

The RBA Intelligence Hub is a library of AI-powered skills built for RBA's teams. Each skill is a proven workflow encoded as a prompt — ready to use in ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, or any AI assistant.

## Who Is This For?

**Everyone at RBA.** You don't need to be a developer to use these skills.

- **Project managers** — Generate project briefs, sprint summaries, and stakeholder communications
- **Business analysts** — Document requirements, map processes, and analyze gaps
- **Designers** — Audit accessibility, document user flows, and review design systems
- **Engineers** — Scaffold components, review security, audit performance, and generate documentation
- **Strategists** — Research technologies, audit content models, and plan migrations

## How It's Organized

### By Role

Skills are organized by the discipline that uses them most:

| Pillar | Disciplines |
|--------|-------------|
| **Strategy** | Project Management, Business Analysis, Digital Strategy, Content Strategy, SEO/GEO |
| **Design** | UX Design, UI Design, Accessibility |
| **Engineering** | Architecture, Front-End, Back-End, Full-Stack, Testing, DevOps, Database |
| **Security & Oversight** | Security, Compliance, Performance |

### By Technology

Skills specific to a platform are also listed under that technology:

| Platform | Partnership Level |
|----------|-------------------|
| **Sitecore** | Platinum Partner |
| **Umbraco** | Gold Partner |
| **Optimizely** | Partner |
| **Microsoft Azure** | Cloud platform |

### Cross-Role

Some skills — like research and skill explanation — are useful to everyone. These live in the Cross-Role section.

## Two Ways to Use Every Skill

Each skill page provides **two formats**:

1. **Copy & Paste Prompt** — Works in any AI platform. Copy the prompt, fill in the variables, and paste it into ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini. This is the simplest way to get started.

2. **Claude Code SKILL.md** — For developers using Claude Code (Anthropic's CLI tool). Install the skill file and invoke it with `/skill-name`. This gives you tool access (file reading, web search, code analysis) that the copy-paste version can't.

See [How to Use Skills](/getting-started/how-to-use-skills/) for step-by-step instructions for each platform.

## What Makes a Good Skill?

Good skills share these traits:

- **Specific** — "Audit WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for a component" beats "help with accessibility"
- **Repeatable** — You'd use this pattern on multiple projects, not just once
- **Structured** — The output follows a predictable format you can rely on
- **Actionable** — The output is something you can use directly, not just information
