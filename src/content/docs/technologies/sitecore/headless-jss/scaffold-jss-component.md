This skill lives under **Engineering > Architecture** because component scaffolding is primarily a developer workflow.

**[Scaffold Sitecore JSS Component](/roles/engineering/architecture/scaffold-sitecore-jss-component/)** — Generate a complete Sitecore JSS component with TypeScript, tests, Storybook stories, and Sitecore template definition.

Use this skill when you need to create new JSS components for Sitecore XM Cloud or XP headless implementations.
